                My Favorite Decemberist Song:
            </h4>
            <h4>
                [Verse 1: Colin Meloy]
Mother, I can hear your footfall now
Soft disturbance in the dead fall, how
It precedes you like a black smoke pall
Still the wanting comes in waves
            </h4>
<h4>
[Verse 2: Colin Meloy]
And you delivered me from danger then
Tore my cradle from the reedy glen
Swore to save me from the world of men
Still the wanting comes in waves, in waves, and waves
</h4>
<h4>

[Chorus 1: Colin Meloy]
And the wanting comes in waves
And the wanting comes in waves
And I want this night
And I want this night
</h4>
<h4>
[Verse 3: Shara Worden]
How I made you
I wrought you, I pulled you
From war I labored you
From cancer I cradled you
</h4>
<h4>
[Chorus 2: Shara Worden]
And now, this is how I am repaid?
This is how I am repaid?
</h4>
<h4>

[Verse 4: Shara Worden]
Remember when I found you?
The miseries that hounded you?
And I gave you motion
Anointed with lotions
</h4>
<h4>
[Chorus 2]
And now, this is how I am repaid?
This is how I am repaid?
</h4>
<h4>
[Verse 5: Colin Meloy]
Mother hear this proposition right
Grant me freedom to enjoy this night
And I'll return to you at break of light
For the wanting comes in waves, and waves, and waves
</h4>
<h4>
[Chorus 3: Colin Meloy]
Still the wanting comes in waves
Still the wanting comes in waves
Still the wanting comes in waves
And you owe me life, and you owe me life, oh
</h4>
<h4>
[Verse 6: Shara Worden]
And if I grant you
This favor to hand you
Your life for the evening
I will retake by morning
</h4>
<h4>

[Chorus 4]
And so consider it your debt repaid
Consider it your debt repaid, repaid, repaid
